<h2> Lesssons Learned </h2>

<p>
I recognize Active Directory is crucial for managing user accounts and network resources. I chose to cover common IT help desk tasks, such as creating user accounts, resetting passwords, and updating group memberships to practice what may be used in a real job. I was able to learn that Active Directory has a vast amount of options when it comes to user management and there will always be something new to learn based on the job responsibilities. With practice I should be able to adapt to what is needed. </p>
